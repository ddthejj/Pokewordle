    <h1>The Goal</h1>
    <p>
        your goal is to guess the mystery pokemon in as few guesses as possible. how do you do that? well... <br>
        <ol>
            <li>you will first pick and enter a random pokemon and select one of its <abbr title="same type attack bonus">STAB</abbr> types to attack with</li>
            <li>the game will then simulate one turn of battle between your pokemon and the mystery pokemon. based on the simulation you will then get some relevant info that will help you identify the mystery pokemon <br> 
                this information will include: <ul>
                    <li>turn order based on the relative base speed stats of each pokemon</li>
                    <li>whether moves used were <abbr title="not very effective">nve</abbr>, neutral, or super effective </li>
                    <li>and if the mystery pokemon is from the same generation as your guess, or a newer or older generation</li>
                </ul> </li>
            <li>using this information and your knowledge of game mechanics, you can now narrow down the possible mystery pokemon and make another guess</li>

        </ol>
